**Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction**

**Overview:**
This project aims to predict customer churn in an e-commerce setting using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and utilizing various predictive models, the project helps businesses identify customers at risk of churn, enabling proactive retention strategies to foster business growth.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Mice library
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

**Project Structure:**
1. `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
2. `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
3. `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific data processing tasks or model training.
4. `models/`: Saved machine learning models for future use or deployment.
5. `visualizations/`: Visualizations generated during the EDA phase or model evaluation.

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebooks for data preprocessing, EDA, model development, and evaluation.
3. Use the provided Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory for specific data processing tasks or model training.
4. Save trained models in the `models/` directory for future use or deployment.
5. Visualizations generated during the analysis can be found in the `visualizations/` directory.
